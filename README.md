# RG-MTM: Reference-Guided Merge Tree Maps

Implementation, experiments, and visualization assets for reference-guided merge tree maps.

RG-MTM diagnoses how far feature anchors must move when a merge-tree hierarchy
is kept, and measures the scalar merge-level cost of optional relaxation. It
preserves the selected extrema and their values. The contribution is a quantified
trade-off, with mixed geometric motion-proxy benefits across datasets.

## Main experiments

| Dataset | Frames | Tree | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|---|
| ERA5 pressure, 1999/2000 | 118 | Join | Atmospheric minima and illustrated conflict |
| Australian fire, 2019 | 30 | Split | More complex feature configurations |
| NOAA OLR, June–July 2024 | 60 | Join | Additional domain and no motion-proxy benefit case |
| China PM2.5, January 2000 | 30 | Split | Selected, sparse descriptive case |
| Ring | 40 | Split | Synthetic expanding geometry |
| Gaussians | 64 | Split | Synthetic hierarchy/position control |

Membership is defined in `analysis/dataset_suite.py`: six sequences / 342 frames.
The 2013/14 ERA5 period and OISST are excluded from main aggregates. Four PM2.5
months are a separate exploratory selection audit. Gaussian motion error is
undefined at the default setting because no clear events occur.

The main methods are TMTM, a reimplementation of ST-MTM, native Hilbert and Morton,
packed reference sorting, and RG-MTM-P / RG-MTM-R. Native curves retain
all processed samples and do not receive optimal filling. This rendering-policy
difference is explicit in the paper. Fixed-X and exact projection are controls.

## Reproduce

Use Python 3.10+ and the pinned dependencies:

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
# Recompute five critical numerical stages on all six prepared sequences:
PYTHONPATH=src python experiments/publication2027/run.py
# Regenerate tables, quantitative figures, organized records and provenance:
PYTHONPATH=src python experiments/publication2027/build.py
# Verify source/figure hashes and numerical manuscript claims:
PYTHONPATH=src python experiments/publication2027/validate.py
```

The scientific/contract tests cover the main suite and 3-D extension. Full numerical runs require prepared raw
inputs; saved records suffice to regenerate publication tables and figures.
The runner writes timestamped status manifests and logs. Exact-frontier,
sensitivity, scalability, and transfer records retained from prior runs are
identified separately. See the experiment README for the explicit ten-stage run.

The organized export includes a 42-row unrounded comparison CSV, a claim ledger,
source/snapshot hashes, and separate `main`, `sensitivity`, `validation`, `transfer`,
and `protocols` folders. No original result files or raw observations are removed.

## Reading the results

Full interval certificates, width-free calibrated order error, and achieved anchor
displacement measure different feasible sets. Scalar-cost means do not bound the
worst frame, and the relaxation eligibility threshold is not an error guarantee.
The motion proxy assumes known identities and is not a participant study. Improved
reference alignment may worsen two-dimensional stress or provide no proxy benefit.

The retained [visualization gallery](results/visualizations/README.md) provides
additional spatial/tree views, six-method temporal maps, fragmentation, and
geometric diagnostics. The new publication figures have PDF, PNG, and SVG exports.
The source reference papers are held locally under `references/`; their text and
figures are not redistributed in the new source bundle.

## Three-dimensional extension

The separate [3-D experiment](experiments/volume3d/README.md) supports temporal
volume inputs, physical-coordinate Q derivation for the public SquareCylinder
velocity data, volume-based feature widths, and full-3-D versus projected motion
evaluation. Its results remain outside the six-sequence / 342-frame main suite.
The 3-D primary baseline is TMTM; ST-MTM is an explicitly optional project
extension. Official FAU Tangaroa velocity-to-speed acquisition and an independently
recorded ECNR VTM release are kept separate, with source checksums and version limits.
An [input audit against the authors' workspaces](results/volume3d/tangaroa-input-audit-20261018/REPORT.md)
corrects the previous Tangaroa pilot: it omitted the authors' mask/clip operations
and used split trees instead of join trees. Its coarse pilot metrics must not be
used as a same-input reproduction of the paper. The audit checks original-resolution
frames 0/100/200 before TTK simplification. The subsequent [full 201-frame experiment](results/volume3d/tangaroa-paper-p10-full201/REPORT.md)
has now completed and passed independent verification on the original 300×180×120 grid,
using the author workspace scalar protocol and pinned TTK 0.9.9 at persistence 10%.
The derived node-count range is 36–186 versus the paper's 50–186; exact reproduction of
the unpublished final trees remains unresolved. [Paper-style figures](results/volume3d/tangaroa-paper-p10-full201/paper_style/README.md)
pair temporal scalar maps with original-resolution volume renderings.
See [the supplement index](results/volume3d/README.md) for saved reports, figures,
threshold diagnostics, and independent raster verification.

The [3-D experiment overview](experiments/volume3d/EXPERIMENTS.md) separates the
official full-grid run, two synthetic mechanism checks, and historical coarse
pilots. The completed full-grid comparison uses TMTM, RG-MTM-P, three RG-MTM-R
eligibility settings, and an exact-projection control. Persistence stays at 10%:
the four RG panels are not the paper's four persistence settings. Cylinder has
not completed a real-data run. Verify the saved 3-D evidence without downloading
the raw data:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src:. python -m experiments.volume3d.verify_saved
```

## Implementation details

`src/rgmtm/` contains the certificate, interval layout, rendering, and baseline
implementations. `analysis/` contains shared preprocessing, exact frontiers,
filling, motion evaluation, and controls. `experiments/publication2027/` supplies
publication orchestration. `results/` retains original computation evidence;
`results/publication2027/` is the organized active snapshot. This repository contains
experimental code and outputs. The current manuscript and matching supplement PDFs are published separately in `publications/`. LaTeX sources, historical drafts, and writing notes stay local; code/results bundles exclude the publications folder.

## Naming and repository migration

The repository is **RG-MTM** and the installable distribution is `rg-mtm`. Import the core implementation from `rgmtm`, including `rgmtm.reference_guided`. Preserving and relaxed modes are **RG-MTM-P** and **RG-MTM-R**. Historical records keep the keys `A` and `R 20%`; `src/rgmtm/names.py` defines the display mapping.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lelewang1109/RG-MTM.git
cd RG-MTM
python -m pip install -e .
PYTHONPATH=src python tools/build_rgmtm_figures.py
PYTHONPATH=src python tools/verify_rgmtm_migration.py
```

The current figure set is generated in `results/figures/rgmtm_*`. Original numeric files, arrays, and historical paper images remain unchanged. `provenance/rgmtm_rename_20261016.json` records exact reversible source edits; validators distinguish historical source hashes from a new numerical run. The separate RA-MTM project retains its own name and Git repository.

## Public repository contents

The repository publishes code, experimental evidence, plots, reproduction documentation, and the two selected PDFs in `publications/`. Editable manuscript sources, historical drafts, and writing notes remain local. Historical experimental figures/tables are in `results/legacy_publication/`; current figures are in `results/figures/`. Run `python tools/check_public_export.py` before publishing. The code/results packager excludes `paper/`, `notes/`, and `publications/`; paper PDFs are downloaded separately.
